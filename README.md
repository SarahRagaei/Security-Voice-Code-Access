# Security Voice-code Access System
A voice-based authentication system that grants or denies access based on **voice recognition** and **spectrogram analysis**. It combines voice passcode recognition and speaker identification and performs authentication in real-time, providing instant feedback on access status.

## Features
### 1. Dual Operation Modes
It works in two distinct modes:

**Mode 1 ‚Äì Security Voice Code:**
- Access is granted only if a user speaks one of the predefined *valid passcode* sentences: ‚ÄúOpen middle door‚Äù, ‚ÄúUnlock the gate‚Äù, or ‚ÄúGrant me access‚Äù.

**Mode 2 ‚Äì Security Voice Fingerprint:**
- Access is granted if the *valid passcode* sentence is spoken by one of the *pre-authorized* individuals.
- The system is trained on 8 different individuals.
- Admin can select which individuals are granted access via checkboxes.

### 2. Voice Recording
Users can start/stop recording voice input via the üéôÔ∏èmicrophone button.

### 3. Spectrogram Viewer
Displays spectrogram of the spoken voice-code in real time for visual analysis.

### 4. Analysis Summary
Presents a summary of the similarity analysis results, including:
- Pie chart showing how much the spoken sentence matches each of the 3 valid passcodes.
- Pie chart showing how much the spoken voice matches each of the 8 trained individuals.

### 5. Individual Authorization
Allows users to select which individuals among the trained 8 users are granted access.

### 6. Access Decision
A clear indicator for ‚ÄúAccess Gained‚Äù or ‚ÄúAccess Denied‚Äù.

### 7. User Interface
Intuitive user interface with clear controls for mode selection, voice recording, spectrogram visualization, and result display.
